This is an Ubuntu Xential based Docker image and is image only contains Open JDK 8 JRE, Android SDK Tools and Android SDK Build Tools.

## Usage

You can use all commands from [Android SDK Tools or Android SDK Build Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line). You can mount a volume optionally, if you would like to pass files to commands.

```
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":"$(pwd)" warnyul/android-build-tools apkanalyzer
```

Or if you want to use platform tools or other Android SDK components, just use this image as parent:

```
FROM warnyul/android-build-tools:{VERSION or latest}

# Install platform tools
RUN yes | sdkmanager "platforms;android-29"

```

## Build

```
git clone https://github.com/warnyul/docker-android-build-tools.git
cd docker-android-build-tools
./build.sh --build-tools-version=29.0.3 --latest
```

## Why Ubuntu Xential?

I use this image to build [redex](https://fbredex.com) in a Docker container. [The documentation of redex](https://fbredex.com/docs/installation) refers to this.
